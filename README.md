## Installation

To install the modified application to your Android device, you can follow the basic instructions below. The application utilizes [Google ARCore Geospatial API](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial). You can see the list of supported devices [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices).

- Clone this repository.
- Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and open the directory `original-repository/samples/geospatial_java` with it.
- To successfully run the application, you need an API key. More information can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/authorization?platform=android). Make sure you've enabled ARCore API and Maps SDK for Android for your API key in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
- After you've got the API key, you need to create two new files inside the opened directory: `local.defaults.properties` and `secrets.properties`. The directory structure would look something like as follows:

```
.
├── .gradle
├── .idea
├── app
├── gradle
├── .gitignore
├── build.gradle
├── gradle.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── local.defaults.properties       # Create this...
├── local.properties
├── secrets.properties              # ...and also this file.
└── settings.gradle
```

Add the 2 following lines ***without changes*** to `local.defaults.properties`.

```
GEOSPATIAL_API_KEY = DEFAULT_API_KEY
MAPS_API_KEY = DEFAULT_API_KEY
```

Add the 2 following lines to `secrets.properties` and ***replace*** the `AIza...` with your own API key(s). You can set the same API key to both variables.

```
GEOSPATIAL_API_KEY = AIza...
MAPS_API_KEY = AIza...
```

- After these configurations, you can install the application to your device using e.g. USB or WIFI connection. See more detailed instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).
